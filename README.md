# Patient reports
Code to create individualized patient reports (containing information on outcomes on self- and observer ratings, such as HAM-D, QIDs, etc.) for patients at the Early Recognition Center of the University Hospital Cologne (FETZ). Implemented as a ShinyApp for convenience. 

*app.R* calls upon *generate_report.Rmd* to create the personalized reports.
